\chapter{Derivation of Approximate Confidence Interval for Sampling Sufficiency ($\theta$) \\ (Equation (3.3))}

The Delta Method permits the approximation of the distribution of a function of a random variable provided said random variable is asymptotically normal.

\vspace{5mm}

Using the univariate Delta Method, an approximate large-sample (asympototic) \\ confidence interval for specimen sampling sufficiency ($\theta$) based on the Central Limit \\ Theorem (CLT) can be derived.  

\vspace{5mm}

For a single parameter of interest, the Delta Method states that

\begin{equation}
\sqrt{n}(g(X_n) - g(\mu)) \rightarrow_d \mathcal{N}(0, [g'(\mu)]^2\sigma^2)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $n$ is the number of observations and $g(X_n)$ is a function of independent and \\ identically distributed (iid) random variables $X_1,...,X_n$ with finite variance $\sigma^2$ \\ approximating some unknown parameter $\mu$.

\vspace{5mm}

For the problem at hand, both $N_i$ and \textit{H}* are constants and $H_i$ is the random variable of interest. In reality, $N_i$ is likely not constant, but is treated as such according to the constant population size assumption implicit in {\tt HACSim}'s underlying model discussed in detail within Chapter 4. For simulation of real species, $N_0$, the initial guess of likely required specimen sample size used to initialize {\tt HACSim}, is known \textit{a priori} since it is equal to the number of specimens/DNA sequences present in the filtered multiple sequence alignment required as input. In addition, the decision to treat $N_i$ as constant avoids the need to use the multivariate Delta Method, which would otherwise require evaluation of several partial derivatives, thus making the mathematics quite cumbersome and tedious.  

\vspace{5mm}

Writing Equation (3.1) as a function of $H_i$ gives

\begin{equation}
g(H_i) = \frac{N_iH^*}{H_i}.
\end{equation}

\vspace{5mm}

Now, differentiating the above expression with respect to $H_i$ using the Quotient Rule, factoring the denominator, and then simplifying leads to

\begin{equation}
g'(H_i) = \frac{-N_iH^*}{H_i^2} = \frac{-1}{H_i}\frac{N_iH^*}{H_i} = \frac{-N^*_{i+1}}{H_i}.
\end{equation}

\vspace{5mm}

By the Delta Method, the estimated variance of \textit{N}* is given by

\begin{equation}
\widehat{Var}[N^*_{i+1}] = [g'(H_i)]^2\hat{\sigma}^2_{H_i} = \left(\frac{-N^*_{i+1}}{H_i}\right)^2\hat{\sigma}^2_{H_i} = \left(\frac{N^*_{i+1}}{H_i}\hat{\sigma}_{H_i}\right)^2.
\end{equation}

\noindent and its corresponding standard deviation and standard error are respectively

\begin{equation}
\widehat{SD}[N^*_{i+1}] = \sqrt{\widehat{Var}[N^*_{i+1}]} = \frac{\hat{\sigma}_{H_i}}{H_i}N^*_{i+1}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\widehat{SE}[N^*_{i+1}] = \frac{\widehat{SD}[N^*_{i+1}]}{\sqrt{N^*_{i+1}}} = \frac{\hat{\sigma}_{H_i}}{H_i}\sqrt{N^*_{i+1}}.
\end{equation}

\vspace{5mm}

Finally, a symmetric CI for $\theta$ can be constructed, leading to Equation (3.3)

\begin{equation}
N^*_{i+1} \pm z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}\widehat{SE}[N^*_{i+1}] = N^*_{i+1} \pm z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}\left(\frac{\hat{\sigma}_{H_i}}{H_i}\sqrt{N^*_{i+1}}\right).
\end{equation}

\noindent where $z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is the $(1-\frac{\alpha}{2})100\%$ quantile of the Standard Normal distribution and $\hat{\sigma}_{H}$ is the estimated standard deviation for the number of haplotypes ($H$) found from sampling \textit{N}* specimens.
