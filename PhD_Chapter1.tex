\subsection{Thesis Overview} \label{sec:intro1}

This thesis outlines a novel statistical framework for assessment of COI DNA barcode haplotype sampling completeness. Much of the work presented herein reflects a spin-off of research completed at the Master's level in bioinformatics.

Chapter 2 consists of an in-depth literature review of studies conducted to date \\ pertaining to sample size estimation for DNA barcoding, as well as the need for further research in this area. A case study assessing haplotype diversity in the ray-finned fishes \cite{phillips2015exploration} provides motivation for subsequent work presented and examined in the present thesis.

Chapter 3 details a novel stochastic optimization algorithm called {\tt HACSim} (short for \textbf{H}aplotype \textbf{A}ccumulation \textbf{C}urve \textbf{Sim}ulator) that is programmed in the R Statistical \\ Environment \cite{r2018language}. {\tt HACSim} can be employed to calculate likely required specimen \\ sample sizes needed to capture a given fraction of genetic diversity within species based on iteratively extrapoling species' haplotype accumulation curves. {\tt HACSim} is applied to various vertebrate and invertebrate taxa of recent interest within the DNA barcoding literature, primarily fishes and arthropods of conservation, medical, and forensic/regulatory \\ importance.

Chapter 4 extends elements discussed in Chapter 3 through delving further into the useability and applicability of {\tt HACSim} via a detailed statistical simulation study to assess both the validity and overall performance of {\tt HACSim} and its utility for assessing \\ intraspecific sampling completeness within DNA barcoding studies for a variety of species mined from the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) \cite{ratnasingham2007bold}.

Finally, in Chapter 5, it is argued that DNA barcoding is currently lacking in statistical rigor and that better statistical methods are necessary to more accurately assess standing genetic variation at the species level. Proposed approaches are illustrated through a case study focussing on Pacific fishes of Canada \cite{steinke2009dna}.

\subsection{Thesis Statement}

Through the development of a novel stochastic simulation algorithm for the generation of haplotype accumulation curves, the current research will provide a framework that can be employed to determine plausible specimen sample sizes sufficient to quantify levels of haplotypic sampling completeness within species under both uniform and non-uniform haplotype frequency distributions.

Such a framework will be valuable in hopefully promoting a greater degree of statistical thoroughness in future DNA barcoding studies. 


\subsection{Statement of Contributions}
  
All chapters presented in this thesis are original and were the sole effort of JDP, \\ including review of the primary literature, conceptualization of ideas, implementation of code, design of experiments and writing of individual manuscripts. All other others either assisted directly with writing of code and/or running of experiments or participated in the editing of final manuscripts versions.
