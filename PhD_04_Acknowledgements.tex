\paragraph*{First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge the support and guidance of my coadvisors, Drs. Dan Gillis and Bob Hanner for their encouragement over the years. In addition, thanks go out to all current and past members of the Gillis and Hanner Lab groups, particularly Rob Young for all the fun times that were had throughout the journey.} 

\paragraph*{Secondly, I wish to thank Dr. Deb Stacey and Dr. Graham Taylor for serving on my advisory committee, graciously reading my individual manuscripts and the current thesis, as well as engaging in stimulating discussion during my many committee \\ meetings and graduate seminars over the past four and a half or so years.} 

\paragraph*{Thirdly, I would like to recognize the tremendous efforts of both Steven French and Scarlett Bootsma for their interest and willingness to learn about the inner workings of the {\tt HACSim} algorithm and assist with coding, debugging and simulation as part of their fourth year thesis projects.}

\paragraph*{Fourthly, a big shout out goes out to graduate students in the Adamowicz, Hebert \\ Hajibabaei and Steinke Labs for their friendships throughout the years, especially Jacopo D'Ercole and Mike Wright.}

\paragraph*{Lastly, I would like to thank my family for their love and encouragement throughout my journey into the vast unknown that is doctoral study. Now they can finally stop constantly asking: ``When are you going to get your PhD.?!"}

\paragraph*{This work was supported in part by a Graduate Excellence Entrance (GEE) \\ Scholarship. Other sources of funding came from various travel grants which greatly aided the ability to travel and present my research at the 7th and 8th International Barcode of Life (iBOL) Conferences held in Kruger National Park, South Africa and \\ Trondheim, Norway in 2017 and 2019 respectively.}
