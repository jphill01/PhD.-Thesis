Each haplotype has an associated numeric ID from 1-\textit {H}* (here, 1-5). Haplotype labels are randomly assigned to cells on a two-dimensional spatial array (ARRAY) with {\tt perms} rows and $N$ columns. All haplotypes occur with a frequency of 20\%, (\textit {i.e.}, {\tt probs} = (1/5, 1/5, 1/5, 1/5, 1/5)).

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.1}{\ignorespaces Traditional dotplot for visualizing the DNA barcode gap for a range of Canadian Pacific fishes assessed by \cite {steinke2009dna} and generated using the BOLD Workbench's Barcode Gap Analysis tool. Data comprise those specimens currently found in the TZFPC BOLD project (as of December 1, 2020) and represent 1219 specimens from 197 species (\textit {c.} 6.18 specimens per species on average). Points lying above the 45$^{\circ }$ line indicate that species show a barcode gap and are readily identified via molecular barcodes. On the other hand, points falling below the 1:1 line suggest that species lack a barcoding gap and thus are not easily diagnosed through their DNA barcodes. Most species assessed here (38 of 197 species (19.3\%)) display a barcode gap since the minimum interspecific genetic distance exceeds the maximum intraspecific genetic distance. Despite this, evidence of species showing a barcode gap may in fact be an artifact of limited sampling of within-species haplotype variation. The species \textit {Cyclothone atraria} at the point (9.22, 22.78) is clearly visible as an extreme outlier and signals possible cryptic species variation.\relax }}{121}{figure.caption.45}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.3}{\ignorespaces plot for the depiction of species' genetic distances reproduced with modification from \cite {hubert2015dna}. Such plots are informative since problematic and/or ``outlier" species can be easily detected and the success/performance of DNA barcoding assessed. Species are partitioned into four mutually exclusive groups based on observed magnitudes of intraspecific and interspecific genetic distances. Here, a 2\% distance threshold is assumed to separate most taxa. The blue dot at the approximate point (9.22, 22.78) within Quadrant II represents \textit {Cyclothone atraria}, a likely cryptic species complex. Plot axes show the relationship to the density curves shown in \cite {meyer2005dna}. While usage of the Kimura-2-Parameter (K2P) DNA evolution model is both widespread and criticized in DNA barcoding studies and the community-at-large \cite {collins2012barcoding, srivathsan2012inappropriate}, other more parsimonious nucleotide substitution models (such as the uncorrected p-distance) can be adopted without loss of information (and may even be better suited in the long run). Theoretically, between-species genetic variation should greatly exceed barcode sequence variation observed within species (Quadrant I; minimum interspecific distance $-$ maximum intraspecific distance $>$ 2\%). Practically, this will only be the case when specimens have been adequately sampled.\relax }}{125}{figure.caption.47}
